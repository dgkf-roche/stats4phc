Description: Performance evaluation for the prognostic value of predictive models intended to 
  support personalized healthcare (phc) when the outcomes of interest are binary. 
  Predictiveness curves are an insightful visualization to assess the inherent ability of such 
  models to provide predictions to individual patients. Cumulative versions of predictiveness 
  curves represent positive predictive values and 1 - negative predictive values and are also 
  informative if the eventual goal is to use a cutoff for clinical decision making. 
  In addition, predictiveness curves and their cumulative versions are naturally related to net 
  benefit performance metrics to assess clinical utility for phc. Finally, some authors have 
  proposed a visualization that assesses both the prognostic value of predictive models and 
  their performance as a classifier. This package provides a variety of functions for estimation 
  and plotting of these performance evaluation curves and metrics.
